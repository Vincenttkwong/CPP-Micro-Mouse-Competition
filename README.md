# Micromouse Maze Solving Robot ü§ñ

This project was developed as part of the **MTRN3100** course by a team of 4 students. Our goal was to design, build, and program an autonomous robot to compete in a **Micromouse maze-solving competition**. Our team achieved the **2nd fastest time** in our cohort during the final competition!

## Project Summary

We developed a two-wheeled autonomous robot capable of:

- Navigating a 9x5 maze grid using onboard sensors and closed-loop control
- Mapping the maze using computer vision from a top-down camera
- Computing and executing the shortest path to the target
- Communicating wirelessly over Bluetooth

The project was divided into several milestones, each building up toward a fully autonomous competition-ready robot.

## Highlights and Learnings

- Learned the importance of early commits and regular communication to avoid last-minute issues, especially when new to Git.
- Gained hands-on experience in C++, particularly in applying DFS for exploration and BFS for shortest path finding.
- Discovered that code alone isn't enough‚Äîhardware reliability is often the limiting factor in robotics.
- Applied control system theory, using a moving average filter to clean noisy sensor data.
- Found a strong personal interest in robotics coding and problem-solving, particularly under real-world constraints.
- Realized the value of modular code structure in making debugging and iteration faster.
- Learned to plan for hardware limitations, balancing theoretical algorithms with practical execution.

## Hardware Overview

The robot was built with the following components:

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Mega
- **Motors**: 2 √ó 25GA370 motors with encoders
- **Motor Driver**: TB6612
- **IMU**: ICM-20948
