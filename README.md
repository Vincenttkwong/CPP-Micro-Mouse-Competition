# Micromouse Maze Solving Robot ü§ñ

This project was developed as part of the **MTRN3100** course by a team of 4 students. Our goal was to design, build, and program an autonomous robot to compete in a **Micromouse maze-solving competition**. Our team achieved the **2nd fastest time** in our cohort during the final competition!

---

## Project Summary

We developed a two-wheeled autonomous robot capable of:

- Navigating a 9x5 maze grid using onboard sensors and closed-loop control
- Mapping the maze using computer vision from a top-down camera
- Computing and executing the shortest path to the target
- Communicating wirelessly over Bluetooth

The project was divided into several milestones, each building up toward a fully autonomous competition-ready robot.
